Website Scraping Analyzer
A comprehensive tool to analyze websites and determine the optimal approach for web scraping. This intelligent analyzer evaluates 28 key aspects of a website to help you make informed decisions about what technologies and strategies to use for your scraping projects.

## Features

Automatically detects whether a site is static or dynamic
Identifies JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
Detects anti-bot protections (Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA, etc.)
Analyzes authentication requirements
Identifies pagination methods
Checks for API endpoints that could be used instead of scraping
Assesses legal restrictions (robots.txt, rate limits)
Provides detailed technical recommendations

## Installation

Python 3.8+
Chrome browser (for Selenium/Playwright)

## Setup

Clone or download this repository
Install required dependencies:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Optional: Install Playwright (for enhanced JavaScript handling and anti-bot evasion):

bashpip install playwright
playwright install


## Usage
Interactive Mode
Run the script without arguments to use interactive mode:
python website_analyzer.py
The tool will prompt you for the website URL and configuration options.
Command Line Mode
bashpython website_analyzer.py https://example.com [options] 

## Options:

-o, --output: Custom output file path (default: domain_limitations.txt)
--no-selenium: Disable Selenium browser automation
--use-playwright: Use Playwright for browser automation (if installed)
-t, --timeout: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
-v, --verbose: Enable verbose logging

## Example Output
The analyzer generates a comprehensive report covering all 28 key questions:
# Website Scraping Analysis for https://example.com
# Generated on 2025-04-29 12:34:56

## Website Structure and Technology
1. Is the website static or dynamic (JavaScript-heavy)? Dynamic (JavaScript-heavy) - Content difference: 64.25%
2. Does the content load asynchronously or require user interaction to appear? Yes - Heavy JS dependency detected
3. What frameworks is the site built with (React, Angular, etc.)? react, webpack
4. Are there anti-bot protections like CloudFlare, Imperva, or similar? Yes: cloudflare, recaptcha

...

## Tool Recommendation Summary
Recommended tool: Playwright - Best for JavaScript-heavy sites with anti-bot protection

Additional considerations:
- Use cloudscraper or similar library to bypass Cloudflare protection
- Implement rate limiting and request delays to avoid IP blocks
- Set up session management to handle authentication
How It Works
The analyzer employs multiple strategies to gather comprehensive data:

Initial HTTP Request: Makes a simple request to get basic information
JavaScript Rendering: Uses Selenium and/or Playwright to render JavaScript
Content Comparison: Compares static vs. dynamic content to assess JS dependency
Feature Detection: Analyzes the DOM for frameworks, anti-bot measures, pagination, etc.
Legal Assessment: Checks robots.txt and other technical/legal constraints

## System Requirements
This tool is designed to work on systems with limited resources:

8GB RAM or higher recommended
Core i5 6th generation or equivalent
250MB disk space (for dependencies)
